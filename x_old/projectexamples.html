<p><b>Project 1</b> | Completed 6 month process to help a local K12 School District create a Strategic Plan.  This involved the Superintendent, his staff and the principals of the elementary, middle and high schools.  The resulting action plans are now focussed on the achievement of their newly created Vision, Higher Purpose and Value statements.  The budgeting challenges are now being faced with a confidence that the decisions will be based on a clearer view of the priorities.</p>
<p><b>Project 2</b> | Working with a non-profit community organization to solidify a shift in Business Model, driven by a new Strategic direction.  This involves recasting the organization in line with the new strategy and redesigning the Financial policies.  The client wants to insure buy in with their Board and disparate organizations that are being integrated into the new direction.  In addition, the client has asked me to lead the upgrade and simplification of its Financial Reporting and Control processes.</p>
<p><b>Project 3</b> | Led a project that created a Corporate level assessment of the Measurement and Management structure for a Fortune 100 company.  The use of Six Sigma principles clarified the proper decision metrics and the necessary linkage to Value Creation.  It was discovered that several organizations within the Corporation had created Balanced Scorecard measures that were inconsistent and not aligned with Value Creation principles.</p>
