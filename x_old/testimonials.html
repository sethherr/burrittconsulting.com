<p>"Harry Burritt played a key role in contributing to the strategies  
and plans that took Whirlpool Corporation from a $4 billion U.S.  
company to a $19 billion global enterprise and the world-wide  
leadership position in the appliance industry. His strong analytical skills, 
his strategic mindset and his business  
savvy were very valuable to me over the twenty years that we worked  
together."</p>

<h2>David Whitwam
<i>Former Chairman & CEO of Whirlpool Corporation</i></h2>

<p>"I have had the privilege of working with Harry Burritt on strategic planning projects for many years. He has a thoughtful process on how to identify strategic issues and create plans to resolve them. Harry is easy to work with and provides outstanding leadership to the planning process."</p>

<h2>Bill Marohn
<i>Former President & Vice Chairman of Whirlpool Corporation</i></h2>

<p>"Harry provided the expertise, guidance, and leadership to take my staff, Board, and all stakeholders through the entire strategic planning process. From developing belief, purpose, and values statements to getting buy in from our community,Harry's knowledge and insights made this process focused, timely, successful and rewarding. Our district now has a working, dynamic plan for the future, against which we can weigh every decision. Harry's encouraging style and depth of knowledge from the corporate world was the perfect combination to move us through this process. I highly recommend Harry to any group interested in improving their focus and decision making through the development of a strategic plan."</p>
<h2>Al Skibbe
<i>Superintendent, St. Joseph Public Schools</i></h2>

<p>"Harry Burritt sets a new "high water mark" for fiscal integrity and financia know-how. Nowadays, you can hire an MBA in Finance - a dime a dozen and you can't be too sure of what you're getting. Mr. Burritt brings a whole new meaning to the notions of financial accountability and acumen. Not only that, he's got a heck of golf game! Really, Harry is an amazing talent in the field of accounting and finance."</p>
