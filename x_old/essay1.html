<h3>You Get What You Measure....Y=f(X)</h3>
<p>When a business fails there is often a post mortem that subscribes the reasons for failure that rings hollow.  Fannie Mae failed because of the credit crunch and sub prime loan defaults.  Enron failed because of incompetence and greed.  One wonders if the pundits really understand the underlying reasons.</p>
 
<p>The failures of a lot of companies surface fundamental issues regarding measurement.  I would argue that a large portion of the cause is poor measurement and that management was just giving the Board and the Shareholders what they thought was being asked for. </p>
 
<p>If one applies Six Sigma principles to Financial measurement some very interesting questions get raised.  While Six Sigma principles have been primarily used to improve manufacturing processes, the principles do apply to Finance.  The use of the equation of Y is a function(f) of x ( Y=f(X)) raises the question of what is the "Y" of a business?  What is the ultimate goal?  Shareholder Value, right?  Well yes, but, the follow-up questions are how do you measure it? and what is  the relationship between the input variables, the "X's" and "Y'?   </p>
 
<p>Enron's answer was increase EPS as fast as possible, even if you have to hide debt and failing investments off balance sheet.  Fannie Mae's answer was to increase the portfolio of mortgage loans as fast as possible, including sub prime loans because that would be helpful to the U.S. real estate market and address the political demands, even if the company had to increase leverage to the maximum taking advantage of the implied guarantee from the government, thereby increasing EPS.  In both cases large bonuses were paid for the meeting and exceeding of the goals.  Clearly, in both cases there was something wrong with the equation.  Something was wrong with what the Board asked management to do.</p>
 
<p>One needs to relook at the "Y".  Are EPS or other measures such as RONA, Revenue Growth, EVA,  ROE "Y's?  Are the input variables really driving improvement in Shareholder Value? I would argue if one applies Six Sigma principles the answer is concerning.  These measures are not primary "Y's".....they are "middle Y's".  In other words, they are potentially misleading.  A company needs to rethink its assumptions,  and rethink how it sets targets and makes decisions to insure the "equation" works.  One needs to identify the primary "Y" in its business and confirm the equation.  Managers need to change the way they make decisions.</p>
 
<p>So, what is the primary "Y" of a business...the stock price?  Yes, over the long term, but what internal measures will be a good surrogates in the short term? This is the right question.  What is the right answer for your business?  I can help you examine this question.  Give me a call. </p>
